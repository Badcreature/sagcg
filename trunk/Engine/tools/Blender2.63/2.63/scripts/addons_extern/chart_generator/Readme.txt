latest version is the file  chart_generator_PKHG.py

add  chart_generator_PKHG.py via the import of addons, or put the file
directly into a suitable addons-directory!

After activation
you have to set  FIRST the absolute path to an existing csv
If not a good path or to big column number no chart can be drawn (see gui ;-))

E.g. use Map1.csv as a test file ;-)

it is a file with lines like, seperator is a , (comma).

name1,value1,value1_1,...
name2,value2,value2_1,...

Negative numbers will prevent percentages and totals and are
discarded in pie-charts
